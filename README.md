# GitHub Stupidity

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/james9909/github-stupidity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/james9909/github-stupidity)

Description
-----------
An application to calculate the stupidity of a GitHub repository, based off [this article](https://ericgreer.info/post/judging-the-stupidity-of-github-projects/). Additionally, you can view the stupidity of a language, calculated from the average stupidity of the top 20 repositories in that language.

Disclaimer
----------
The calculations produced by this application do not reflect my views or opinions of any GitHub repository or language, and are purely meant for fun.
